	abstract = {Despite the increasing use of social media sites to engage consumers, the consumer brand engagement construct is still in its infancy. This study aims to contribute to existing social media research by proposing and empirically testing a model in which social media brand involvement and social media brand communication are the main precursors and brand relationship quality is a relevant outcome of social media brand engagement. The ﬁndings show that the inﬂuence of social media brand involvement on social media brand engagement is stronger than the inﬂuence of social media brand communication. The latter is due to the co-creation of users and ﬁrms. Furthermore, interaction and attention are the most relevant components of social media brand engagement, followed by enthusiasm, identiﬁcation, and absorption. Social media brand engagement is a useful tool for companies to gain competitive advantages. Thus, the ﬁndings could help ﬁrms better manage their social media tools in the context of social media communication.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine how ﬁrms implement social media systematically to drive strategic marketing actions. To this end, the study conceptualises social media implementation as a multidimensional, organisational construct composed of social media strategy, active presence, customer engagement initiatives and social media analytics. Using primary data, the study operationalises the social media implementation construct and tests its eﬀect on ﬁrm performance isolated into social media performance and marketing performance. The results indicate that all except the active presence dimension of social media implementation are positively related to social media performance. The results further indicate that social media performance is positively related to marketing performance. The study contributes to the literature by oﬀering a novel conceptualisation and empirical validation of the social media implementation construct.},
